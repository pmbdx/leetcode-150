In this repository, I am going to solve the Top Interview 150 study plan from LeetCode.
Inside the main folder, you will find three subfolders, each named according to the exerciseâ€™s level of complexity.
I hope that if you are also solving these exercises, you find inspiration here. 
I know that my solutions may not be the same ones you would think of, but I hope they give you another point of view.
